            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>The like has not been for this many a year:</l>
               <l>The River of <hi>Thames</hi> was congeal'd to a Rock</l>
               <l>And people in multitudes thither did flock;</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Then let us be thankful and praise God therefore,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Frost it was sharp most bitter and cold,</l>
               <l>It pierced all people the time it did hold:</l>
               <l>Great Cole-Merchants they that had laid in their store</l>
               <l>Was void of all pitty, and grinded the poor</l>
               <l>And in their extremity it did appear,</l>
               <l>They bought 'em in cheap, but they sold 'em out dear</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then let us be thankful, and praise God therefore,</hi>
               </l>

            <lg>
               <l>Poor Trades-men that great charge maintain</l>
               <l>I needs must confess they had cause to complain</l>
               <l>Their hearts was oppressed with sorrow and care;</l>
               <l>They walkt up and down, but most bleak was the ayr</l>
               <l>And Charity that was as cold as the wind,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On this mighty River they there did invent,</l>
               <l>All kind of vain pastime to reap their content;</l>
               <l>They acted all rudeness there with one accord,</l>
               <l>And little regarded the hand of the Lord:</l>
               <l>Many poor Families suffered this time,</l>
               <l>Whilst some drowned sorrow in Glasses of Wine;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>From <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> to the <hi>Temple</hi> each day,</l>
               <l>The River of <hi>Thames,</hi> 'twas made a High-way;</l>
               <l>For Foot-men and Horse-men, and Coaches beside,</l>
               <l>And many brave Gentlemen in them did Ride;</l>
               <l>But all this great Triumph we justly might fear,</l>
               <l>Might make our sad Iudgment to fall more severe;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then during this Frost there they followed their blows,</l>
               <l>In Musick and Gaming, and acting of Shows;</l>
               <l>On this mighty River they Roasted an Ox,</l>
               <l>They Bated the Bull, and they Hunted the Fox:</l>
               <l>But yet I was troubled those pleasures to see,</l>
               <l>For fear that our Lord he should angry be;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>But when they perceived the great Frost it did break,</l>
               <l>They were forc'd to pack up, and thee <hi>Thames</hi> to forsake:</l>
               <l>The Wind and the Tide it has brok it in sunder,</l>
               <l>And now we will leave them to talk of the wonder:</l>
               <l>Then let us rejoyce still, and be of good chear,</l>
               <l>We hope we may have a most plentiful year;</l>
